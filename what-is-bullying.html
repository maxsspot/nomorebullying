		<p id = "des">The CDC defines bullying as, "any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) that involves an imbalance of power, and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated". This can be both physically and mentally draining for the student being bullied. If you are getting bullied in Pennsylvania there's this one website where you can anonymously report them called <a href = "www.safe2saypa.org" rel = "noreferrer">Safe2Say</a>. If you're not in Pennsylvania you should still report them to a trusted adult.</p>
